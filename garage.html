    <h1>Micro:Bit Garage Door Project</h1>
    <h2>Made by Xavier</h2>

    <img src="images/garage-main.jpg" alt="Garage Door Opener with Micro:Bit in action">

    <h3>What is this project?</h3>
    <p>I made this automatic garage door for our cardboard house project. It's a working door that moves up and down smoothly, just like a real garage door. The door uses a Micro:Bit to control when it opens and closes, making our cardboard house more realistic and fun to use.</p>

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>The garage door is simple to use. Here's what it does:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Press the A button on the Micro:Bit to make the door go up</li>
        <li>Press the B button to make the door come down</li>
        <li>The door moves smoothly on its track</li>
        <li>It stops by itself when it's fully open or closed</li>
        <li>You can open and close it as many times as you want</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why is it useful for our cardboard house?</h3>
    <img src="images/garage-side-view.jpg" alt="Side view of the garage door mechanism">
    <p>This garage door makes our cardboard house much more interesting. Here's why it's important:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It works just like a real garage door, making our house more realistic</li>
        <li>You can put toy cars through the door, just like a real garage</li>
        <li>Visitors can try opening and closing it themselves</li>
        <li>It shows how we can use Micro:Bit to make things move in useful ways</li>
        <li>The door makes our house look more complete and finished</li>
    </ul>
